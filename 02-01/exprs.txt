Question 1

A short is a number that is  16 bits long. An int is a number  either 16
 bits or 32 bits long. Both floats and doubles are floating point numbers,
 meaning that they have numbers after the decimal. The float is 32 bits and the double is 64
bits.The short and int are both whole number values, while the float and
double are both rational numbers with decimals. Min and max for short are
-32768 and 32767. Min and max for int are -2147483648 and 2147483647. Min
and max for double are 1.7976931348623158e+308 and
2.2250738585072014e-308. Min and max for float are 3.402823466e+38 and
1.175494351e-38.

Question 2

The reusult of y is 3.0000. Because it is a float and it gets rounded down.

Question 3

int i has a a value of 0 because it is not changed.
int j is 0 because it is not changed.
int x is i incremented by one which is 1.
int y is j incremented by one which is 1.
